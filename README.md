Burro
=====

This is the reference distribution for Burro, a formal programming language
whose programs form a group under concatenation of their program texts.

For the definition of the Burro language version 1.0, which was the
first attempt to do this but does not actually succeed in forming a group,
see the file `burro-1.0.html` in the `doc` directory.  (This should
probably be converted to Markdown someday, but that day is not today.)

For the definition of the Burro language version 2.0, which does indeed
form a group, see the Literate Haskell file `Burro.lhs` in the `src`
directory.  This also serves as a reference implementation of the language,
and includes a sketch of a proof that Burro is Turing-complete.
